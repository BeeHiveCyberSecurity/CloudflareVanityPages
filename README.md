But with these customized block and error page templates (and a Pro+ subscription), you too can customize yours from these easy-to-use templates.

# How to use these
Like our WAF-IPDB tool for Cloudflare - this is a template repo. 

**First**. [clone this repository by clicking here while signed into a GitHub account](https://github.com/new?template_name=CloudflareVanityPages&template_owner=BeeHiveCyberSecurity).
Then, pull down and begin customizing your pages in any proper development software. Notepad++ works, Cursor works, Visual Studio Code works...whatever works. 

Each template has different aspects that are customizable according to your branding.
